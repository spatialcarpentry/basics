Vector data uses features \(features are usually points, lines or polygons\) to represent discrete phenomena in the real world. For example, a vector data file might include a river represented by a line which is assigned a value. For data which is associated with discrete entities like countries, landmarks, roads, etc. vector data is the way to go.

### Vector Data Types

The Geometry Object Model from the Simple Features for SQL specification:

This structure allowed developers to rely on a standard system for storing spatial data types and representing the relationships between different spatial data types.

Some of the most used spatial data types are:

Point 
  : A Point is a 0-dimensional geometric object and represents a single location in coordinate space. A Point has an x-coordinate value, and a y-coordinate value. If called for by the associated Spatial Reference System, it may also have coordinate values for z and m.

LineString 
  : A linestring is a Curve with linear interpolation between Points. Each consecutive pair of points defines aLine Segment. A  line is a LineString with exactly 2 Points. A Linear Ring is a LineString is a LieString that is both closed and simple. A linestring is a series of connected points. These points act as vertices or nodes and are connected by curves. Each curve is assigned a start point and end point whcih represents the cardinality of the linestring. This cardinality is used to designate an order from the starting point to the end point.

Polygon 
  : A Polygon is a planar Surface defined by 1 exterior boundary and 0 or more interior boundaries. Each interior boundary defines a hole in the Polygon. Polygons are topologically closed. THe boundary of a Polygon consists of a set of LinearRings that make up its exterior and interior boundaries. No two Rings in the boundary cross and the Rings in the boundary of a Polygon may intersect but only as a tangent.  A series of connected line strings

### Data formats

 * Shapefile: Stores point, line, and polygon data. This file type is actually made up of a collection of files with the following endings: These are mandatory: .shp, .shx, .dbf There are many others which are optional, including the important .prj file that describes the projection information for that data.
 * File/Personal Geodatabase: Esri proprietary spatial database. Very easy to load data into, not so easy to extract. Newer version of QGIS (2.8) is configured by default to read proprietary Esri geodatabases.
 * GeoJSON: Encodes points, lines, and polygons (and collections of those) along with information about them using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). This format is popular for web maps.
